# Hi there, I'm Dr. Shalini Sankar! 👋

## 🙋🏽‍♀️ About Me

Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio.

I am a scientific professional with a PhD in Cancer Research, two years of postdoctoral research specialising in CRISPR gene editing, and three years of oncology drug discovery experience at a world-leading CRO. As I transition from the wet lab to the field of data science, this portfolio represents my journey and development across various domains, including bioinformatics, computational biology, and machine learning.

With a focus on real-world applications within the life sciences, particularly in drug discovery, my work here showcases projects that blend scientific insight with data-driven techniques. Each project reflects my commitment to leveraging computational methods to address key biological questions and drive advancements in therapeutics.

Thank you for visiting; I hope you find these projects insightful.
