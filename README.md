# Hi there, I'm Dr. Shalini Sankar! 👋

## 🙋🏽‍♀️ About Me

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I'm a scientific professional with a PhD in cancer research, 2 years of postdoctoral research with a specialism in CRISPR gene editing and 3 years of oncology drug discovery experience in a world-leading CRO. This repository showcases my work and progress as I transition from a scientific research background into the field of data science. I hope to build a portfolio that spans diverse areas within data science, such as bioinformatics, computational biology, and machine learning.

## 🛠️ Skills

- R 
- Python 
- SQL for storing and processing information in a relational database
- Git version control
- Jupyter environments & Anaconda distribution
- Genomic data analysis 
- Machine learning (Supervised and Unsupervised Learning)

## 🔧 Techniques that I will be covering:

- **RNA-Seq Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of RNA-Seq data using tools such as DESeq2 and visualization techniques like PCA and heatmaps.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Development of predictive models for cancer drug responses based on gene expression data, mutations, and drug properties.
- **Data Science Methodologies**: Exploration of various data science techniques, from data cleaning and preprocessing to statistical analysis and visualisation.

## 🔧 Languages and tools that I will be using:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
    - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
